        The function initializes an empty list called tasks. It then creates a ThreadPoolExecutor 
        with a maximum of 17 workers and a requests session.

        Next, it initializes an event loop, and for each row or task in the task_list, it executes
        the custom_function using the session, obj, args, and kwargs as parameters. This is done
        using loop.run_in_executor() and functools.partial().

        The tasks list is updated with the resulting tasks from each execution. Finally, the tasks
        are initiated to run, and their results are awaited. If an error occurs during the execution,
        it is caught, and an error message is raised with the corresponding exception captured by Sentry SDK.
