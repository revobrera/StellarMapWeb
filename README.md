# Django Stellar Lineage and Radial Tree

Welcome to the Django Stellar Lineage and Radial Tree application!

This web application allows users to generate the lineage of Stellar addresses and visualize them in a radial, tidy tree format. The tree maps address types and activity, providing a clear and organized view of the relationships between addresses.

To get started, users can input a Stellar address to generate the account lineage. The application will then retrieve data from the Stellar network and display the address information in the radial tree. Users can customize the tree by filtering by address type and activity, and can also hover over individual nodes to view more detailed information about each address.

In addition to the address visualization, the application also includes a transaction history feature that allows users to view a list of all transactions associated with a particular address.

This application is built using Django, a powerful web framework for Python. The front-end utilizes JavaScript and D3.js for the radial tree visualization.

### Additional Tools

In addition to the Django web application, we also offer StellarMap, an open-source, cross-platform PyQt desktop app that allows users to explore the Stellar blockchain network. StellarMap makes API calls via horizon.stellar.org and api.stellar.expert to retrieve data and provide a comprehensive view of the Stellar network.

With StellarMap, users can view address information, transaction history, and network statistics in an easy-to-use interface. The app also includes a built-in faucet for creating and funding test addresses, making it a useful tool for developers and enthusiasts alike.

Whether you're using the Django web application or StellarMap desktop app, we hope our tools help you navigate and understand the Stellar network more easily. We welcome any feedback or contributions.
